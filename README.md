# Carcassonne

This project is a digital version of the board game Carcassonne. It is intended to be playable by both human and bot 
players, with the goal to be able to provide a platform for competitive bot development using a common protocol (gRPC)
to allow development of bots in a wide variety of languages, and compete them with a matchmaking and ELO-style ranking
system.
